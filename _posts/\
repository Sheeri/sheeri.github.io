Now that you've created your Atlas database, import the sample dataset:

1. Get the mock data and import
   1. git clone URL
   For now, extract <A HREF="/assets/files/CodeForGoodDataSet.tar.gz">CodeForGoodDataSet.tar.gz</A>.
   1. Find the path to the directory CodeForGoodbackup, which contains a directory called "wildaid".
1. Get connection string
   1. Click CONNECT in the cluster itself (or as previously on the "all clusters" page for the project):

   1. Click on Connect using MongoDB Shell, then "I already have the mongodb shell"
<img src="/assets/images/Click_Already_Have.png" style="border:1px solid black" width="100%"><BR><BR>
   1. Copy the connection string

1. Import with mongorestore using the path and connection string. Make sure to add your username in place of USER in the connection string, followed by @ and then the hostname"
   1. `mongorestore --uri "mongodb+srv://USER@CLUSTER.mongodb.net/wildaid" /PATH/TO/CodeForGoodbackup`
1. Check with Data Explorer
